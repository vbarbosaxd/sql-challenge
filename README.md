# SQL Challenge
## Project Overview
In this assignment, I imported CSV files into a SQL database and answered questions about the data. This was done in three parts: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.

## Data Modeling
I inspected the CSV files and based on the data, I created the ERD below.

## Data Engineering
Based on the CSV files, I created a SQL table schema for each file that included data types, primary keys, composite keys, and foreign keys.

## Data Analysis
After creating the SQL tables, I conducted a variety of queries that involved joins, aggregate functions, wildcard operations, aliasing, and subqueries.
